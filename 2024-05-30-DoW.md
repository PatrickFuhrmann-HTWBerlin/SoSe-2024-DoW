## What we did!

### Excercise I

Everyone created pull request from a fork of the **oai-pmh-view** repository and patrick merged it with original.

### Team work

- I organized the  winner images of the 2023 Helmholtz Imaging reward, which we could use as examples for raw data, which we have to annotate with metadata.
- In preparation of the final show, Isabell and Ellen designed some example posters.
   - We have two alternative layouts a) Circle around a synchrotron b) a linear layout with tiles.
- We discussed the content with the following result: ![layout](https://github.com/PatrickFuhrmann-HTWBerlin/SoSe-2024-DoW/blob/main/assets/SoSe2024-Show-Poster-layout-sketch.png)
- Images are [here](https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/apps/files/files/651183762?dir=/HTW) and that's where we could share ideas too.
- I can print an first version of the poster and bring it for review if electronically available until noon 2024-06-18.   

## What we have to do until next time!
- Patrick has to ask Habakuk whether we can bring an A0 and how much space we will have in general.
- You have to agree on a posterlayout.
- Coding on oai-pmh
   - Carlo wants us to work on the master of the oai-pmh-service code.
   - In preparation he merged changes from newer branches in the master/main.
   - Please clone the master of the original scicat oai-pmh-service repository
   - Remove the package-lock.json and the module_nodes and try to install the latest modules.
   - Try to get the code compiles and run with those changes.
