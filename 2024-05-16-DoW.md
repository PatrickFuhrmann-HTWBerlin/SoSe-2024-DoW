# Description of work for 2024-05-09

## What we want to achieve!

Up to now we managed to get our own 'scicat live mini' installed on our laptops or in Juelich. 
The limited scicat live only runs the following containers:
* mongodb
* mongo express viewer
* the backend v4

One of the issues is that the backendv4, the scicat project provides, doesn't support the new Mac ARM based M1/2/3. So we had to compile the backend ourselves.

The work until 9/5/2024 splits into two preparational steps:
* Build our own image for the backendV4
* Get scicat live installed and running
  
and one new step:
* Intergrate the oia-pmh services into our scicat-live-mini.
