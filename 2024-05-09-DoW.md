## What we want to achieve!

Up to now we managed to get our own 'scicat live mini' installed on our laptops or in Juelich. 
The limited scicat live only runs the following containers:
* mongodb
* mongo express viewer
* the backend v4
* and traefik router

One of the issues is that the backendv4, the scicat project provides, doesn't support the new Mac ARM based M1/2/3. So we had to compile the backend ourselves.

New next step, and this is our job for 9/5/2024 is to intergrate the oia-pmh services into scicat-live-mini.

## Tasks

### The new Backend
 * Get the new [SciCat backend](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next) from GitHup**
 * Create an Image of the backend (v4) for your platform (Mac intel, Mac M1/2/3 or Linux)
 * Name the image **my-backend**.

### Scicat live (mini)

#### Get scicat live to run
* Fetch our [scicat live mini](https://github.com/PatrickFuhrmann-HTWBerlin/scicatlive-mini.git)
* Check if the 'image' parameter in the services/backendv4/docker-compose.yaml file is set to either
  - the official image. (For INTEL)
  - our image, which you created before (**my-backend**)
* run scicat mini live.

Service | Port 
-------:|------
7008 | Mongo Express
7009 | Backend REST API
7010 | Traefik

#### Check if it's working
* Point your browser to 'http://localhost:7010'. You should see the 'traefik' dashboard
* Run the following command
```
curl -L --silent -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:7009/api/v3/Datasets" |jq '.[].pid'
```
