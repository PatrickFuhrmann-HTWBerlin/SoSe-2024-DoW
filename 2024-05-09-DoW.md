 # Description of work for 2024-05-09

## What we want to achieve!

Up to now we managed to get our own 'scicat live mini' installed on our laptops or in Juelich. 
The limited scicat live only runs the following containers:
* mongodb
* mongo express viewer
* the backend v4
* and traefik router

One of the issues is that the backendv4, the scicat project provides, doesn't support the new Mac ARM based M1/2/3. So we had to compile the backend ourselves.

New next step, and this is our job for 9/5/2024 is to intergrate the oia-pmh services into scicat-live-mini.

## Tasks

### Build an image from the backendV4 code.
 * Get the new [SciCat backend](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next) from GitHup**
 * Create an Image of the backend (v4) for your platform (Mac intel, Mac M1/2/3 or Linux)
 * Name the image **my-backend**.

### Run Scicat live (mini)

#### Get scicat live to run
* Fetch our [scicat live mini](https://github.com/PatrickFuhrmann-HTWBerlin/scicatlive-mini.git)
* Check if the 'image' parameter in the services/backendv4/docker-compose.yaml file is set to either
  - the official image. (For INTEL)
  - our image, which you created before (**my-backend**)
* run scicat mini live.

Service | Port 
-------:|------
7008 | Mongo Express
7009 | Backend REST API
7010 | Traefik

#### Check if it's working
* Check with 'docker ps' if the following service are running
   - mongodb
   - mongo express (view)
   - backendv4
   - traefik
* If something goes wrong, use 'docker logs [container ID]' to see the log files from the containers.
* Point your browser to 'http://localhost:7010'. You should see the 'traefik' dashboard
* Run the following command
```
curl -L --silent -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:7009/api/v3/Datasets" |jq '.[].pid'
```
The command should list a set of id's from the mongodb. 
If the command fails run a similar command :
```
curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:7009/api/v3/Datasets"
```
and try to get from this why the docker compose backend doesn't work properly.

### Integrate the oai-pmh service into our docker-compose mini.

#### Our oai-pmh service
* Get our [oai-pmh](https://github.com/PatrickFuhrmann-HTWBerlin/oai-pmh-service) repo from GitHup
* Compile it locally to check if it is configured correctly.

**Big Tasks**
* **Build an image from the oai-pmh service and integrate this image into our SciCat-live-mini**.
* The listen port for the service API should be on 7005
* !!! Warning: the current internal port is set to 3000. This will clash with the internal port number of the backend service port. So you need to change this.
* Start the oai-pmh service within docker-compose.
* 
**Check if successful**
* Check with 'docker ps' if the oai-pmh services is running.
* If not check with 'docker logs [container ID] why not.
   * If the service had stopped, check with 'docker ps -a' for the container ID and cherk the logs.
* From outside the service should be accessible with **http://localhost:7005**
  * The command 'curl http://localhost:7005' should return the time, the service started and the number of millisecs it is already running.
  * Like this **{"started":"2024-05-05T14:06:30Z","uptime":20004191.728}**
